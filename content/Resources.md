## Italian

I personally learned Italian after learning Spanish, which is the pathway most Americans will likely take if they decide to learn Italian - for that situation, I found the following articles by a Professor at Lancaster University, Adam Letchford. His website was filled with broken links and I had to guess the file address to get access to all the resources. Given this, I wanted to ensure that I would continue to have access to them, so I downloaded the html files and hosted them on my [archive domain](http://archives.kjonasj.com).

Here are all the articles he wrote:
